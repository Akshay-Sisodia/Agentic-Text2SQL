# Sample Database Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the sample database feature in the Agentic-Text2SQL application. The feature allows users to immediately experience the application's capabilities without needing to configure their own database connection.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Sample Database Generation

The sample database is a SQLite database (`sample_huge.db`) generated using the `generate_sample_db.py` script. It contains a retail store schema with the following tables:

- `categories`: Product categories
- `products`: Products with references to categories
- `users`: User information
- `addresses`: User addresses
- `orders`: Order information
- `order_items`: Individual items in orders
- `payments`: Payment records for orders
- `reviews`: Product reviews from users

The database is generated with a substantial amount of mock data:
- 10,000 users
- 2,000 products
- 50 categories
- 100,000 orders
- 30,000 reviews

### 2. Default Database Connection

The application has been modified to automatically connect to the sample database at startup:

1. A `SAMPLE_DB_PATH` constant was added to `app/core/database.py` to store the path to the sample database.
2. The `get_database_url()` function was updated to use the sample database by default for SQLite connections.
3. An `initialize_default_database()` function was added to `app/api/api.py` to establish a connection to the sample database at application startup.
4. The FastAPI application's lifespan context manager was updated to call this initialization function.

### 3. Database Connection Endpoint Updates

The `/api/v1/database/connect` endpoint was updated to:

1. Accept parameters for constructing a database URL or use a direct database URL
2. Fall back to the sample database when appropriate
3. Provide information about whether the sample database is being used

### 4. Query Processing Updates

The query processing endpoint was updated to:

1. Check for an active connection and attempt to connect to the sample database if no connection exists
2. Provide clear error messages if no connection can be established

### 5. Database Status Updates

The database status endpoint was updated to include information about whether the active connection is to the sample database.

## Testing

The implementation was tested using a dedicated `test_sqlite.py` script, which verifies:

1. The sample database exists at the expected location
2. Direct SQLite connection to the database works
3. SQLAlchemy connection using `get_engine()` works correctly
4. Basic queries can be executed against the sample database

## Future Improvements

1. Add a UI indicator to show when the sample database is being used
2. Include a button in the UI to reset the sample database to its original state
3. Add more comprehensive sample queries specific to the sample database schema
4. Create additional sample databases for other database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

## Conclusion

The sample database implementation provides a seamless out-of-the-box experience for users of the Agentic-Text2SQL application. New users can immediately see the application's capabilities without needing to configure their own database, while still having the flexibility to connect to their own databases when needed.
